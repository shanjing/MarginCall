I have a production service I’m deploying that spans multiple repositories with their own docker-compose files. They each have their own application stack hosted across multiple machines (just 1 instance so low bandwidth tolerant service). Everything is deployed, but I’m running into some issues. 
1. Some runtime logic is constructing absolute URLs using the staging domain instead of the current production domain. As a result, images won’t load because they’re prefixed with stg. When it shouldn’t be there.
